Hey Cody here's my bio for the site........'Hey guys I'm Jason, but you can call me Jay. I started off with technology by gaming as a young kid and handling FTP servers. When arriving at Temple I realized security was the field for me and have learned a variety of concepts in the area. There will always be a need for security and with new technologies brings new flaws. Anything that can be made or developed can be broken down too, and it is for these reasons that security draws me in. Feel free to stop me on campus or send me an e-mail regarding any questions in the field or on tech you may have!'
